I finally got around to creating a new blog!

It took a couple iterations. I first played around with [jekyll][jekyll]. It was easy to set up, it had the basic features I needed for blogging, and it was certainly fast enough as a simple static website. But the developor experience was more like what I had 5 years ago.

I wanted something a little more fun, so I landed on [Gatsby][gatsby]. It may be trendy, but it's trendy for a reason. I'm still a firm believer in using isomorphism for certain cases, but the JAMstack is the perfect architecture for this. (It's really just an old architecture with new paint, but it's still the right choice.)

I used to blog over on the [Medium platform][medium]. I'll leave the old posts there for posterity, but I'm going to start writing posts here instead.

I'm excited to get writing again. I'll have code experiments, tutorials, and just things I find interesting. Next post soon&trade;.
