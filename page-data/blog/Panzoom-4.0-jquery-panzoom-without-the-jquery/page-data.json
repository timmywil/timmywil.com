This rewrite has been in the works for a long time, so I’m proud to introduce Panzoom 4.0!</p>\n<h2>Rewrite highlights</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Completely removed the jQuery dependency. Panzoom 4.0 has no dependencies and is even smaller than before (about 3.5kb gzipped).</li>\n<li>Panzoom now supports Pointer Events wherever available, falling back to mouse and touch events. Panning, pinch zooming, and focal point zooming have first-class support.</li>\n<li>Rather than passing callbacks or using jQuery events, the new Panzoom triggers native events. For instance, listen to the <code>panzoomend</code> event with <code>elem.addEventListener('panzoomend', ...)</code>.</li>\n<li>Panzoom has been rewritten in TypeScript. Types are included with the package.</li>\n<li>Documentation is now generated from TypeScript types and a custom script concatenates it all into the README.</li>\n<li>Panzoom no longer uses complicated matrix calculations internally and instead relies on what browser implementors have already built. Moving to this paradigm played a major role in reducing the code size. Customizing the transform is easy with the new <code>setTransform</code> option.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How is this different from other panning and/or zooming libraries?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Many libraries use JavaScript animations rather than CSS transitions.</li>\n<li>Panzoom supports <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PointerEvent\">Pointer Events</a>, even when pinch zooming on mobile devices!</li>\n<li>Panzoom is tiny (3.5kb gzipped). There are powerful libraries that support things like focal point zooming, but those libraries are often significantly larger.</li>\n<li>Panzoom relies on the native event API for events rather than redefining an event system using callbacks (i.e. <code>elem.addEventListener('panzoomend', ...)</code> instead of <code>Panzoom(elem, { onPanzoomEnd: fn }))</code>.</li>\n<li>Panzoom defines TypeScript types. Many libraries are written in JS and have no types.</li>\n<li>Panzoom supports SVG, which is not necessarily uncommon, but because it uses CSS transforms, SVG follows the same codepath as HTML. This also helps Panzoom stay small.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<p>Install Panzoom using <code>yarn</code> or <code>npm</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">$ <span class=\"token function\">yarn</span> <span class=\"token function\">add</span> @panzoom/panzoom</code></pre></div>\n<p>or</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">$ <span class=\"token function\">npm</span> <span class=\"token function\">install</span> @panzoom/panzoom</code></pre></div>\n<p>Check out the demo here: <a href=\"https://timmywil.com/panzoom/demo/\">https://timmywil.com/panzoom/demo/</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Panzoom 4.0: jquery.panzoom without the jquery.","date":"December 16, 2019","description":"Panzoom 4.0 is a complete rewrite of my old jquery.panzoom plugin that removes the jQuery dependency and makes it a universal library"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/Panzoom-4.0-jquery-panzoom-without-the-jquery/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/Automate-React-Native-Deployment-Part-2/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Automate React Native Deployment - Part 2"}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2149165137","495387789","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
